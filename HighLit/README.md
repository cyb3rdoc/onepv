# HighLit - Safety Literature Highlight Tool (v0.1)

Improve your safety literature review in pharmacovigilance by highlighting safety keywords

### Background
As per EU Good Pharmacovigilance Practice (GVP) - Module VI, the medical literature is a significant source of information for the monitoring of the safety profile and of the risk-benefit balance of medicinal products, particularly in relation to the detection of new safety signals or emerging safety issues. Marketing authorization holders (MAH) are therefore expected to maintain awareness of possible publications through a systematic literature review of widely used reference databases (e.g. Medline, Excerpta Medica or Embase) no less frequently than once a week. Since literature articles usually mention only generic name of the medicinal products, MAH receives huge volume of literature publications for review each week.

### Literature Review Process
After screening for medical literature on reference databases, each abstract and/or full-text, as applicable, is manually reviewed by safety data analysts to identify company suspect drugs and potential adverse events. Additionally, it must be analyzed if the article reports single or multiple case reports or narrates events for a cluster of patients. Initial review is followed by in-depth review by safety physicians to finalize minimum safety information (identifiable reporter, identifiable patient, suspect medication, potential adverse event) and author's attribution for causality.

### Problem Statement
It's often time-consuming and overwhelming process to read through these publications to identify potential adverse events and also analyze author's attribution for causality to the suspect medicinal products. It is particularly challenging as medical literatures are not written for pharmacovigilance perspective hence often such attribution is not clear and requires expertise in reviewing medical literature. The process is akin to finding needle in a haystack.

### Proposed Solution
While no solution can replace an expertise of a safety professional, it certainly enhances one's capabilities if important safety keywords and targetted medicinal products are readily highlighted in review document containing literature abstracts and/or full-texts.

### What HighLit can do
1. Highlight and colorize safety keywords and focused words
2. Identifies targetted medicinal products
3. Identifies potential case reports
4. Identifies potential meta-analysis, systematic reviews, animal studies, in-vitro studies, etc.
5. Identifies special population reports
6. Coverts '*.txt' PubMed input files to more readable and modified Word documents
7. Customize target keywords and medicinal products

### What HighLit cannot do
1. Identify author's attribution for causality
2. Eliminate need of medical review of literature publications
